# Python Weather GUI

This project utilizes python module tikinter in order to create a graphical user interface also known as a GUI.
This gui connects to open weather map's API in order to send a request and retrieve weather information based on said request.
If the user gives a valid request then it will display the weather for the location the user entered,
as well as corresponding icon based on current weather. It also displays the 5-day forecast. Due to outdated API from Yahoo the comparison
Functionality had to be removed since Yahoo now uses a multitude of different API's instead of an individual one.
To use the API download the repo and within file 'dist/' look for 'WeatherApp.exe' which is the exectuable that does not need an IDE in order to run.
Simply a double click and it should open up.
